[Live-Link](https://mrasksalot.github.io/Precious_Giggles/)


## This is the second project in The odin project , i didn't follow the odin's model fully and i didn't put much time into the fonts but i learned alot doing it

### Doing the project i learned :
- How to structure a landing page before coding it, drawing the design beforehand saves alot of time 
- How to position items in a way that suits the needs of the case 
- Practice flexbox , img scaling and get to know and use the object-git property
- The slide show idea which was used in the testimonials' section 
- get comfortable with commiting via VSC for better commit description 
- Deployed and debugged the site multiple times before commiting, hence i didn't make as many errors in the commits as i used to do
- learned a bit about the UI design

#### Note : The design is not responsive yet , i haven't grasped the media query part yet and i will come back to fix it once i do
